RUNTIME COMPLEXITY
-Describes the performance of an algorithm.
-How much more processing power/time is required to run  your algorithm if we double the inputs?

-Reverse string algorithm is a linear runtime or "N"
-For each additional character = 1 step through 1 loop.

-The steps algorithm is a quadratic runtime or N^2.
-As n increased by one, we had to wayyy more stuff, or n*n things total

DIFFERENT RUNTIMES:
-Constant time: 1
- No matter how many elements we're working with, the algorithm/operation/whatever will always take the same amount of time.
-Seen as the "holy grail".
-Some interviewers might ask a question and there is a uber easy solution, but then they'll ask for the constant time solution.

-Logarithmic time: log(n)
-You have this if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesn't double the amount of work.
-Always assume that searching operations are log(n)

-Linear time: n
-Iterating through all elements in a collection of data.
-If you see a for loop spanning from "0" to "array.length", you probably have "n", or linear runtime.

-Quasi-linear time: n * log(n)
-You have this if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesn't double the amount of work.
-Always assume that any sorting operation is n*log(n)

-Quadratic time: n^2
-Every element in a collection has to be compared to every other element. The "handshake problem".

-Exponential time: 2^n
-If you add a SINGLE element to a collection, the processing power required doubles.
-Want to avoid this one at all costs!!!

(These are not the ONLY runtimes, other runtimes exist, but in general for whiteboarding questions, the algorithm will fall under one of these categories (or some combo of two))

-Big "O" Notation
-They might ask "What is the runtime complexity of your solution?" === "What is the Big O of your solution?"
-Both asking "What is the efficiency of your solution?", what is the runtime?
- O(n) -> Linear
- O(1) -> Constant
- O(n^2) -> Quadratic

IDENTIFYING RUNTIME COMPLEXITY
-Iterating with a simple for loop through a single collection? -> Probably O(n)
-Iterating through half a collection? -> Still O(n). There are no constants in runtime. (a constant is double or half or 1.5)
-Iterating through two DIFFERENT collections with separate for loops? -> O(n + m)
-Two nested for loops iterating over the same collection? -> O(n^2)
-Two nested for loops iterating over different collections? -> O(n * m)
-Sorting? -> O(n*log(n))

SPACE COMPLEXITY
-Might be asked the space complexity of an algorithm.
-Space complexity is extremely similar to performance but it is a reference to how much RAM or memory or space and algorithm needs to complete a task
-For the most part can apply general rules of runtime complexity to space complexity

DATA STRUCTURES
QUEUES
-Ways of organizing information with optimal "runtime complexity" for adding or removing records
-JS natively implements several data structures. 
!!!IMPORTANT!!!
-YOU WILL BE ASKED ABOUT "INFERIOR" DATA STRUCTURES.
-What's meant by that is in JS array functionality is VAST, very powerful, but we will still be asked to build a queue (not very efficient)
-Going to make an array out of a queue...
-Queues can be thought of as a container of sorts, where records or pieces of data enter on one end of the container and exit on the other side. Like a line of people buying tickets.
-No skipping/cutting in line! The order in which you enter the queue is the order in which you exit it
-Process of adding a record is called adding a record or ENQUEUING 
-Process of removing a record is called removing a record or DEQUEUING 
-FIFO-> First in First out
-Using array methods: adding to the front of an array -> array.unshift() and removing from the end of an array -> array.pop()
-A common way to work with queues is to make a class  and inside that class initialize an empty array, from there we're going to limit our array to just the unshift and pop methods, renamed as add and remove. 
-This is done because the interviewer is telling us to, but also that way the functionality of the queue is explicit, for both ourselves and future coders. By removing the additional array methods via class, we are spelling out that "this is a queue, and you can't do array methods on it".

STACKS
-Stacks are similar to queues. To add a record we push it on/in and to remove a record we pop it out.
-The big difference between stacks and queues is the order of how items are added or removed. Instead of FIFO we have FILO
-FILO -> First in Last out
